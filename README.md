# ScienceArts

This repository is used to provide code for plotting bmp files with individual matplotlib.pyplot colormaps.

- A method plotArts() is provided, that can be used to plot all bmp files contained in a given folder.
- Single bmp files can be processed with the method HeatMapplotter().

This tool can be used to convert physical data input, e.g. laser beam intensity distribution plots. As a result, the user gets the same image but plotted with another color scheme, that can be chosen. 
This makes physical data more appealing for the public and can be interpreted as arts as well. To be more precise I want to call this form of arts:

**Science Arts**!
